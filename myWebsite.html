    <p>I am currently a computer science major at Sacramento State on track to graduate Fall 2024.
      I was a student at LMC on a 3 year plan to transfer for a computer science degree. I currently
      have an associates in liberal arts: Math and Science, an associate for transfer degree for mathematics,
      and graduated with honors in May of 2022. My GPA at LMC was 3.7. I have also filled out the 
      requirements for the IGETC certification and have received this certification. I was a shift lead at 
      Jamba Juice in the Sacramento area part time to help pay for school. My duties involve managing my
      workers and deploying my over 4 years of service.
